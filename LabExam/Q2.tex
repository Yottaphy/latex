\section{Recoil separators, reactions, energy losses}

\textbf{a)} To select the appropriate beam and target combination to use to produce \ce{^{120}La} in MARA, firstly, we need to determine what the possible beam compositions are. For that, we can visit the ECR Beam Database \cite{beams} of the University of Jyväskylä's Ion Source Group.
