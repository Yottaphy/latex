%abstract = {Grain is a data analysis system developed to be used with the novel Total Data Readout data acquisition system. In Total Data Readout all the electronics channels are read out asynchronously in singles mode and each data item is timestamped. Event building and analysis has to be done entirely in the software post-processing the data stream. A flexible and efficient event parser and the accompanying software system have been written entirely in Java. The design and implementation of the software are discussed along with experiences gained in running real-life experiments.}
